# A Better Password Today
Simple online password generator; made by Sangwon Kim in July 2017 as a practice to build a simple web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to learn how to utilize Git in development.

## Features
- Generate password made of digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, spaces, and special characters
- Users can choose the length of the password, kind of letters, and the minimum number of digits, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. When spaces and special characters are checked, they will be included in the password at least once.
- The password is generated by default when the user enters the website. Default settings include the length of 8, at least one digit, lowercase letter, and an uppercase letter, and no spaces or special characters.
- Easy copying by clicking on the generated password

## Credits
- "All-CSS Toggle Switch" and "Custom Checkbox" from [Free Frontend](http://freefrontend.com/css-checkboxes/) were used.
- "Sweet Morning" from [uiGradients](https://uigradients.com/#SweetMorning) was used for background gradient.

## TODOs
- Fix bugs
  - Options disappear when "Hide options" is clicked in mobile view and then window is expanded
  - In mobile view, `slideToggle()` (`slideUp()` and `slideDown()`) isn't smooth
  - "Generate Password" button hover and active effects are buggy in mobile
